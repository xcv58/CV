{Structuring Uncertainty Using the \href{http://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/projects/maybe}{maybe} Statement}
{Leader}
{}
{}
{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce \href{https://blue-systems-research-group.gitbooks.io/maybe/content/concepts.html}{maybe syntax} to enable uncertainty programming for mobile system,
implement \href{https://blue-systems-research-group.gitbooks.io/maybe/content/}{all componments}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Custom Java Compiler, translate maybe syntax to oridnary Java code and bytecode
      \item Gradle Plugin, provide seamless experience for Android developers to use maybe syntax: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYcQ7WVunmc}{demo video}
      \item Web App, use Meteor to provide REST API and reactive web app
      \item Android Library, communicate with maybe backend and cache choices
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

{Studying the Topic of Extracting Attributes and Their Values of Domain Objects}
{Research Proposal for Master degree}{}{}
{
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Used NLP and semi-supervised Machine Learning to extract attribute or attribute value from encyclopedia websites
  \end{itemize}
  % \begin{itemize}
  % \item Collect the seed of attribute and value pair by the semi-structured data from encyclopedia websites
  % \item Construct the described models of object attributes and object attribute values
  % \item Train classifier by the sentences which contains the expression of attribute or attribute value
  % \item Extract the attribute or attribute value from the candidate sentences by trained classifier
  % % \item Experiment results on three domain show that the algorithm is valid
  % \item Sources of Data: 3500 Articles concerning computer, military and archaeology
  % \end{itemize}

{Theory and Method to Ontology Learning Field about Chinese Text}
{Cooperate with team and maintain previous projects}
{Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China}
{}
{
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Tagged and standardized time expressions from Chinese free text
      \item Designed and implemented a web platform to demonstrate all subprojects (written in different languages)
  \end{itemize}
  % \begin{itemize}
  % \item Took over projects: tag the time expressions; standardize the time expressions
  % \item Obtained and marked data, in charge of the maintenance and optimization work
  % \item Designed and implement a web platform to demonstrate all projects of group online
  %   \\The platform was developed by me and my collaborator and the projects were
  %   implemented by different languages.
  %   % Engaged in designing and programming platform of
  %   % ontology learning field-Chinese free text
  %   % (achieved software copyright, owned by group)
  %   % \item Achieved software copyright (owned by group), which showed all projects of group to the ordinary by performing in web-page
  % \end{itemize}
