{
  \begin{tightitemize}
  \item Introduce \href{https://blue-systems-research-group.gitbooks.io/maybe/content/concepts.html}{maybe syntax} to enable uncertainty programming for mobile system,
implement \href{https://blue-systems-research-group.gitbooks.io/maybe/content/}{all componments}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Custom Java Compiler, translate maybe syntax to oridnary Java code and bytecode
      \item Gradle Plugin, provide seamless experience for Android developers to use maybe syntax: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYcQ7WVunmc}{demo video}
      \item Web App, use Meteor to provide REST API and reactive web app
      \item Android Library, communicate with maybe backend and cache choices
    \end{itemize}
